# PseudoLikMultiDHeisenberg
The code finds the optimal set of interecations which maximize the Log-Pseudo-Likelihood function of a Boltzamann distribution associated to a generalized Heisenberg model with multidimensional spin variables. Analytical expressions of Log-Pseudo-Likelihood function and its gradient are in the paper M.G. Izzo, C. Daraio, L. Leuzzi, G. Quaglia and G. Ruocco, 'Worldwide bilateral geopolitical interactions network inferred from national disciplinary profiles' https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07165.
